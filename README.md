## Self-Reflection:
I found that the logical operators section and the arrays section taught me the most about Javascript that I did not know before which was cool. I also feel that th lessons learned from these exercises can be easily implemented into my own code and can be used to improve the overall quality of my coding which is nice.

### How long it took you to finish this?
I do not remember when I started but I belive around an hour or an hour and a half.
